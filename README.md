# Beginners Tutorial

This tutorial contains information about common tools and frameworks used to create web applications.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source version control system.

If you are new to git, you can read [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), primarily chapters 1, 2, 3 and 5.

After that you can read about three git workflow and branching models:

* [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* [A stable mainline branching model for Git](http://www.bitsnbites.eu/a-stable-mainline-branching-model-for-git/)
* [Introduction to GitLab Flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/gitlab_flow.html)

## Database

### JDBC

[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) is a Java API to connect and execute query with the database.

### JPA / Hibernate

[JPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) is a Java API specification that describes the management of relational data in applications.

As an implementation of JPA can be used [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) framework. 

An example of using Hibernate JPA can be found [here](http://tomee.apache.org/examples-trunk/jpa-hibernate/README.html). 

### Flyway

[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/) is the open-source tool that makes database migrations easy.

Official site contains general information on [database migrations](https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/why) and [how Flyway works](https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/how).

Also there you can find information about how to implement [database migrations with Flyway on Java](https://flywaydb.org/getstarted/java).

## JavaScript

If you are already familiar with JavaScript, you can just [refresh your JavaScript knowledge](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).

For a better understanding of JavaScript, yo can read the [modern JavaScript tutorial](https://javascript.info/), primarily Part 1.

## AngularJS

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is a structural framework for dynamic web apps.

A great way to get introduced to AngularJS is to work through [this tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial).

## ReactJS

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

In [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) you can learn how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.

Also you can read [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs) for a better understanding of React.

### React Router

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is the standard routing library for React.

### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

On the [official site](https://redux.js.org/) you can find [general information](https://redux.js.org/introduction) about Redux, as well as [basics](https://redux.js.org/basics) and [advanced](https://redux.js.org/advanced) walkthroughs.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.

## Vaadin Framework

[Vaadin Framework](https://vaadin.com/framework) is a Java UI framework that simplifies web app development.

[This tutorial](https://vaadin.com/docs/v8/framework/tutorial.html) gives you an overview of how you can use Vaadin Framework to build single-page web UIs for your Java application.

## Spark Framework

[Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) is a micro framework for creating web applications.

Here you can find [documentation](http://sparkjava.com/documentation) and [tutorials](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/).

To improve your practical skills you can go through the following tutorials:

* [Building a JavaScript todo-list app](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/ajax-without-writing-javascript)
* [Building a contact app](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/cloud-contact-app)
* [Building a Twitter clone](http://sparkjava.com/tutorials/twitter-clone)

## Play Framework

[Play](https://www.playframework.com/) is a high-productivity Java and Scala web application framework that integrates the components and APIs you need for modern web application development.

All the necessary information can be found in the [official documentation](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/1.4.x/home).

## Spring Framework

[Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) is a framework for easy Spring application creation.

[This page](https://spring.io/guides) contains a list of official Spring guides.

I recommend to begin with the following tutorials:

* [Building an Application with Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)
* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)

If you need more information about Spring (e.g., integration with [React](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/)/[Angular](https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest-angularjs/)/[Vaadin](https://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/), [securing](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-security-architecture/) an application) you can find it by the [link](https://spring.io/guides) above.
